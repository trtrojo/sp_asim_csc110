Create a class person. Each person has a name, height and weight, BMI.

 Create 10 object instance of person.
 Use initalize these objects using the real values.

 Create an array object of Person with size 10.

 Insert all your 10 objects in the array.

 Iterate over your array using a for loop. Use the height and weight of each person and calculate his/her BMI and store the value of BMI inside that person.

 After the first for loop is finished, create the second for loop. Inside that loop check each person and if his BMI is normal, print a message that "Weight of X is normal" (Replace X with the name of the person)

 Inside the other loop check the BMI of each person and for those who are obese print a message "X is obese"

 You may reuse your old code for BMI.

 For thinkers: Check to see if you can use methods.
